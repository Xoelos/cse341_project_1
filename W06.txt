After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:
https://cse341-project-1.herokuapp.com/

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/Xoelos/cse341_project_1

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
The ability to search and add a post, the ability to create an account and login with the account.

Dummy Account to use: email=hi@me.com password=Password1!

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
Looking at posts created by user (To edit/delete), ability to update user profile/password, ability to like and comment on posts as a stretch goal.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
Classes and modularization!

6. What is a benefit of having a foreign key constraint?
Database integrity is incredibly important! Foreign keys enforce standards and can be use to cascade on delete to remove orphaned data.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

3.

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
The modularization I used is great! Adding in deleting and updating should be a pretty quick process but they are missing currently. The framework for updating and deleting is ready, mainly the view and the model.
